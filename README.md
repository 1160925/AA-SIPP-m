# AA-SIPP-m
It's a prioritized planner, e.g. all agents are assigned unique priorities and paths are planned one by one in accordance with the imposed ordering using AA-SIPP (any-angle SIPP) algorithm. The latter builds on top of the SIPP planner, which is tailored to path finding for a single agent moving amidst static and dynamic obstacles (other agents in this case).
